const FAQS = [
  { q: "What should an AI usage policy include?", a: "At minimum: who it applies to, which AI tools are approved, what data may and may not be entered into AI tools, transparency and disclosure rules, any regulatory obligations (EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2), and who owns the policy and handles breaches. ModelCharter's generator produces all of these, tailored to your answers." },
  { q: "Is this AI usage policy template free?", a: "Yes. The generator is free with no signup. You can copy the policy, download it as Markdown, or save it as a PDF. Treat it as a strong starting point, and have your own legal or compliance advisor review it before adopting." },
  { q: "How is this different from a static template?", a: "A static template is one-size-fits-all. This generator changes the actual clauses based on your industry, risk stance, what data your team handles, your approved tools and which regulations apply, so you get a policy that fits your company, not a generic document." },
